### Introduction

StarRail Gacha Tracker is a Python-based program designed to simulate and record gacha (loot box) draws in gaming. Its primary function is to assist users in tracking their progress in gacha games, including both character and weapon draws.

### Features

- **Pool Selection**: Choose between character or weapon gacha pools.
- **Draw Input**: Enter the number of draws already made for accurate pity count calculations.
- **Draw Result Recording**: Record the outcome of each draw (3-star, 4-star, or 5-star).
- **Real-Time Statistics Update**: Keeps track of the number of draws made and the remaining draws until the next guaranteed high-tier item.

### How to Use

1. Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.
2. Download the `StarRail.py` file to your computer.
3. Run the program from the command line:
   ```
   python StarRail.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts for operations.

**OR**

Open the starRailGacha.exe file in the dist folder.

### Input Guide

- Upon starting, select the type of gacha pool you wish to track.
- Input the number of draws made in the selected pool when prompted.
- After each draw, input the result of the draw.
- The program will provide real-time statistics based on your input.

### Future Development

- **Local Save Functionality**: Plans to implement a feature that allows users to save their gacha records locally, enabling long-term tracking and data persistence.
- **Dynamic 5-Star Draw Probability**: Enhance the program to dynamically adjust the probability of drawing a 5-star item as the number of draws increases, reflecting the changing odds in real-time.
